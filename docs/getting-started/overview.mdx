## What Is **Nuclei?**

Nuclei scans modern applications, infrastructure, cloud environments, and networks to help you find and fix vulnerabilities fast.

Under the hood, Nuclei uses templates—simple YAML files—that describe how to detect, prioritize, and remediate specific security vulnerabilities.

Hundreds of security researchers and engineers from around the globe contribute to the Nuclei template ecosystem. To match your adaptability to the ever-evolving threat landscape, over 5,000 templates are available in the Nuclei tool and updated regularly, including templates addressing real-world exploits and latest attack vectors, like the Log4j vulnerability, GitLab RCE, and many others. Each template represents a potential attack vector and includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, its severity and priority score, and, where possible, trending exploits the vulnerability enables. 

The template-driven Nuclei approach is highly flexible and ensures that vulnerabilities detected by Nuclei aren't merely theoretical—they indicate a genuine risk of being exploited in the real world.

Once configured, Nuclei can provide detailed information on each vulnerability, including:
